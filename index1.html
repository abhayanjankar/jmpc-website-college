                <p>Being aware of the fact that knowledge leads man into the realm of heavenly bliss, Late Manoharbhai Patel felt an urge to ameliorate the lot of people of the Bhandara District District in this direction. When this idea dawned upon him, Bhandara district was lagging far behind the other regions of Maharashtra in the field of education.<br> In order to realise his dreams, he began
 
                    to seek advice and cooperation of other like-minded people in the district. As a result of his untiring efforts, The Gondia Education Society was formed in 1958 and set up its first degree college for Arts & Commerce at Gondia, called NMD College.<br> In a brief span of forty years, the society has been able to establish a network of 14 degree colleges, 12 Junior Colleges and 12 high schools. This speaks volumes of the rising spirit of the Education Society .However, an effort is on at college levels to introduce newer courses. The Gondia Education Society is contributing enormously to the field of education and thus rendering a yeoman's service to the society in general</p>

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>J. M. Patel College at Bhandara is a premier institution not only of the Gondia Education Society but also of the Nagpur University and in the region as well.<br> In order to spread the light of knowledge and education lit by Late Manoharbhai Patel, and to make it more pervasive, Late Natwarlal Patel came forward with all his generous contribution. Consequently, J. M. Patel College was set up in 1964 in the pious memory of Late Shri Natwarlal Patel's father Late Shri Jashbhai Muljibhai Patel.<br> It is worth mentioning that this college started as only Arts & Commerce College in the beginning. <br>But thanks to unbounded zeal of the management, the principal and staff and other well wishers of the institution, it has enormously risen almost to great heights within a short span of only four decades. Now this college imparts education in various disciplines like Arts, Commerce and Science upto the Post Graduation Level. In order to enable the people of the district keep pace with the business world and the growing market, this college started the Diploma Course in Business Management in the session 1984-85 in the new 'Department of Management Sciences & Research Centre'.</p>
